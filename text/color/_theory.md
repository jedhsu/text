The space of colors is a doubly conic space.
- White is the end of one cone. Black is the end of another cone.
- The circular ring is hue.
- Key for balance is that the distance from white to black, should be set.
- This means that the Euclidean distance of the two "isosceles ends" of the triangle
- taking a slice through the vertical line of this geometra is obviously higher, but the color distance
- should be the same. This is how you construct the distance!
- Pure grey is at the "center" of this geometra.

- Another critical part is that the triangles of the hue ring have a constant equivalence relation.
- Also, interesting that pink is a fake color...

So the relations are... triangles on the hue ring.
"Arcs" on the hue ring

- homeomorphic to HSV cake, the "point" is expanded to a bottom circle.
- The top cone is pushed down into a "bottom cone".
- The bottom cone becomes an "inverse cone" loooking like a valley.
  - The lowest point of this bottom cone (grey) is half the height of the sides.

- hue is circumfuerence
- saturation is radius
- value is height / level

- This implies every HSV point (n, 0, y) since the "ring" shrinks into a "point" with 0 radius is the same color.
  - e.g. (0, 0, 50%) = (120, 0, 50%) = base grey
