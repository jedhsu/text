Notes are for white theme. (just reverse?)

* Emph2 text is darker.
* Code Block has top and bottom borders, slightly grey 
* enumerations (1, 2) are styled

What subset of the css language do you actually need?

MVP:
* Decent section formatting
* Simple side bar
* Markdown composer
* Some basic Sphinx or otherwise doc codegen
* Golden ratio proportions lol why not

* Rainbow color idea where appropriate.
* Canon hyperlinks with tasteful highlighting

* Throw some uncontroversial abstract symbols a tiny bit

Future:
* simple hover animations
* side comments

Dope Future:
* picture as squares


Don't need:
* tables
* most animation

"""
* serif font
* github, linkedin as text
